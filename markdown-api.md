# Markdown API

An idea.

Markdown API as a service, for serverless Jamstack sites with out blog sites without git repos. Could inject gatbsy.config at run time with a markdown source.

Or use with an editor.

Or use for an app like [[foam]]. Part of [[foam-api.md]] plan.

## Git-Backed

Use github actions to respond to POST events and write markdown, then serve a JSON API API [[serve-json.md]] from github. Private repo becomes cheap, but slow private API.

Good for static build, less good for dynamic sites.

Reads can be sped up with proxy/ cache. Writes will always be slow. Using [swr](https://swr.vercel.app/) to send the update will allow for the update to happen in cache/ client first. This will require using [mutation](https://swr.vercel.app/docs/mutation).

## Markdown Editor And API

[[meadow]] Halloween now has a markdown editor and reading/ write/ render markdown from Github repo. Can extract all of this.

App would be a vercel app, with next-auth github auth, like Meadow has. Would provide list route, edit route and delete route. Also an editor.

## Buisness

Making this a template repo, that can be deployed on Vercel and writing about it on [dev.to](http://dev.to/shelob9) would be cool. It would also be a good way to see if anyone else thaught this was cool and if so how would they use it.

Could be a hosted version is the Buisness here, but I want to see if anyone uses the free/ open-source version first.
