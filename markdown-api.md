# Markdown API

An idea.

Markdown API as a service, for serverless Jamstack sites with out blog sites without git repos. Could inject gatbsy.config at run time with a markdown source.

Or use with an editor.

Or use for an app like [[foam]]. Part of [[foam-api.md]] plan.

## Git-Backed

Use github actions to respond to POST events and write markdown, then serve a JSON API API [[serve-json.md]] from github. Private repo becomes cheap, but slow private API.

 Good for static build, less good for dynamic sites.

 ## Full API

 Laravel app.

 DB, auth, oAuth, eComm and markdown to HTML handled.
