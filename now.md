# Now

## What I Am Working On Now

At work, my main focus is building internal apps -- user telemetry and customer support applications. This helps us understand our users and the [[wordPress]]ecosytem better. I get to build most of that with [[Laravel]] and [[React]], which is super fun.

I'm a nerd for this stuff, and spend a lot of time reading about how we think and create as an internet. This leads to building my own CMSes from time to time. That is also very fun for me.
