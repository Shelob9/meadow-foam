# Notes About Serverless

## Render.com

## Vercel

Used for:

- [Imaginary Shapes](https://imaginaryshapes.com) - a React app.
- [[laravel]] application -- internal tooling at work.

### Laravel on Vercel

- Copy [this example](https://github.com/juicyfx/vercel-examples/tree/master/php-laravel)
- Change `VIEW_COMPILED_PATH` in `now.json` to `/tmp`
- Set APP_KEY using Vercel's environment variables to keep it secure.
