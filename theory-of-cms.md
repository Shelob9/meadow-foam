# Theory of Content Management Systems

Traditionally, we have two models -- blog/ page builder and wikis. In the blogs/ page builder category -- Geocities, Squarespace, Shopify [[WordPress]] -- you have flexible model where authoriship is visible and relationships between content is defined implicitly through taggin. In the second category -- Wikipedia being the archetype, but not only implimentation of Wikimedia's software, which isn't the only Wiki software -- authorship is collective and relationships between content emerge through linking.

## Hyper-Generalized Distinctions

WordPress and similar CMSes:
- Clarifies authorship
  - Makes creation a singular act.
- Defines visible bounderies around embeds.
  - oEmbeds
  - iFrames
  - Blockquotes in HTML.
- Mutli-author via multiple identities
  - Discussion via forum/ comments
  - Multi-author blogs

Wikipedia

- Obscures authorship
  - Makes creation collective
- Obscures embeds
  - Transclusion
- Encourages open collaboration and editting
  - Defaulys to open editting.

Social networks don't fit into this categorization. Neither does Roam or [[Foam]], sort of. Roam is a single author knowledge graph with wiki-style links that structure emerges from. It's both really. Roam is a working on multiplayer. That and the #RoamCult ecosystem make it into more of a network.

WordPress -- WordPress.com and the open source ecosystem -- don't really fit that distinction either. Sites are optionally federated using Jetpack. Reusable blocks add wiki-style transclusion a default feature of the software.

## Everything Is A Graph Anyway

Graphs of relationships are an emergent property of content creation and human conversation. Technologies like Roam, Git or GrpahQL or graph databases allow us to design communication systems with the understanding that we are creating a graph.

This is the difference between meta graphs and intentional graphs. Meta grpahs are emergent, intentional grpahs are not, but meta graphs due emerge between them.
