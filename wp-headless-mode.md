# WordPress Headless Mode

## WordPress Headless Mode

Serves WordPress sites that are being used for content authoring and serving content via REST API and/ or WPGraphQL to decoupled front-end or use with a [[static-stite-generator]].

### Free WordPress Plugin

Blocks all requests to site besides wp-admin, wp-json and wp-graphql.

- [Github Plugin](https://github.com/Shelob9/headless-mode)
- [Headless Mode](https://wordpress.org/plugins/headless-mode)

Important missing feature: Per page/ endpoint pattern block to allow some pages to be served via traditional WordPress, use [[next]] or [[gatsby]] or whatever for most pages. This will allow for gradual adoption of headless WordPress instead of all in.

### Headless Mode Worker

As an add-on to the Headless Mode plugin, use Cloudflare workers to:

- Block requests to WordPress site not allowed by plugin, at network level, unless logged in.
- Serve wp-json as static API.

I wrote an article and proof of concept of the server -- using [[express]]

[//begin]: # "Autogenerated link references for markdown compatibility"
[static-stite-generator]: static-stite-generator "Statice Site Generator(s)"
[next]: next "Next.js"
[gatsby]: gatsby "Gatsby"
[//end]: # "Autogenerated link references"
