## Problem Space

###  Use My Accumulated Status To Grow Audience In A Slightly Different Direction

I'm known for building WordPress plug-ins, teaching about it and having opinions on the quality, security and ethics of it
 Also saying hi to Roy.

What's interesting to me is building things I can't build, preferably collaboration software. I've been trying to figure out how to do that for awhile. I'm getting way better, but I became known for adjacent skills that have more monetary value but are not the thing.  I want to be known for building collaboration tools. Not better typewriters -- can't beat Google Docs -- typewriters are for two sets of hands

. I want to build things that are centred on the idea that we don't create as individuals, but as a collectivei don't know how to do that, but it's what I've been after since I got into this. Not knowing how to do it is fun and we'll figure it out.

### Imaginary Coins

The email list is not bey set up so I can sell people stuff something next week. It is going to mention a lot of things that Saturday Drive sells and my friends sell and cool shit I might buy. But right now, I have no plans to sell you a course or ebook. I thought about it, but I have a good job, I'd rather write in the open and build more of a following now. That's more fun and more worth it to me then more money then I need.

Also, I have a valueless, personally branded digital currency to play with for fun.  Seriously. I like the idea of having an email list that is sort of about crypto, and I keep making jokes about my PretendCoin.

## Beta Testing Period

I would like to have a small beta testing group that recives the first 3-6 newsletters. That way I feel like I'm writing to someone and there are stakes, but it's less scary. I'd like to get some feedback on what I am trying to do from people who know me and would be willing to pay a more someone who is better at this then me to give some critical feedback.
