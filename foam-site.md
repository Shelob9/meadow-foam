# Foam Site

By default [foam](https://foambubble.github.io/foam/) uses Github pages. Would be cool if it used [[next]] or [[gatsby]] ?

[//begin]: # "Autogenerated link references for markdown compatibility"
[next]: next "Next.js"
[gatsby]: gatsby "Gatsby"
[tailwind]: tailwind "Tailwind"
[mdx-editor]: mdx-editor "MDX Editor"
[//end]: # "Autogenerated link references"

Take these notes and give them basic views with [[tailwind]] or use something like [gatsby-theme-andy](https://github.com/aravindballa/gatsby-theme-andy). Show [foam graph](https://github.com/foambubble/foam/blob/master/packages/foam-core/src/note-graph.ts)

## Editor

[[mdx-editor]] is one idea.
