# MDX Editor

I started a [MDX editor](https://codesandbox.io/s/mdx-editor-vxrj4?file=/src/App.tsx) proof of concept while thinking about [[foam-site.md]]. Makrdown is great, but I want to be able to embed clippings from [[meadow]]. I have been thinking about a [[block-editor]] either the one from [[wordpress]] or [[editorJs]] but maybe MDX or a MDX block editor is enouhg?

[//begin]: # "Autogenerated link references for markdown compatibility"
[meadow]: meadow "Meadow"
[wordpress]: wordpress "WordPress"
[editorJs]: editorJs "Editor.js"
