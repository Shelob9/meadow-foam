# Meadow

Networked second mind(s) app.

## Why

## Main Features For v1

- Clippings: Link sharing with support for native share api.
- Leaves: Private written notes with embeded clippings.
  - Probably not needed.
- Bubbles: Git-backed [foam bubbles](https://foambubble.github.io/)
  - Editor with clipping embeded.
- Graph of relationship between all content.

### Othe Early Ideas

- Replace PWA with Electron app.
- [[wordpress]] plugin that makes clippings and bubbles reusable blocks.

### Overview

- [[laravel]]
- Deployed on [Render](https://render.com)
- VueJS front-end

After trying for awhile to over-engieer this app using Node on the backend, I decided to simplify things. I am using Laravel for CRUD, REST API and authentication.

Laravel and VueJS also gave me a fast way to prototype UI, and think about how this app could work.

Currently what is deployed is an API for two data types and that basic UI. The app is installable -- I used Laravel PWA and a custom [[service-workers]] I wrote. The service worker does provide basic caching, but it's primary purpose is native share withe share API.

## Halloween

The proper front-end client for Meadow. Displays leaves and bubbles. Includes markdown editor for bubbles.

### How Halloween Works

Uses:

- [[next]] next.js
- [[service-workers]]
- [[editorJs]] editor.js
- Theme UI
- Github pages
- [Next Auth](https://github.com/nextauthjs/next-auth)

## Foam

This site, for now. [[foam-site]]

Could add clippings, leaves, etc of meadow to the [foam graph](https://github.com/foambubble/foam/blob/master/packages/foam-core/src/note-graph.ts) and add interlinking.

Second Brain + Link clipping app is a nice MVP for meadow, right? Does that rule even apply here?

## Link Share/ Clippings With Quotebacks (MVP) + Clippings Plug-in For Gutenberg (MVP+1)

Use existing meadow app for clipping share. Maybe keep levaes as small private notes. Link shares shown publicly with quote backs.js

Create WordPress plug-in/lib for quotebacks.js

Create clippings WordPress plug-in that makes all clippings into reusable blocks, rendered with quotebacks
