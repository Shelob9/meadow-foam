### Overview

- [[laravel]]
- Deployed on [Render](https://render.com)
- VueJS front-end

After trying for awhile to overengieer this app using Node on the backend, I decided to simplify things. I am using Laravel for CRUD, REST API and authentication.

Laravel and VueJS also gave me a fast way to prototype UI, and think about how this app could work. 

Currently what is deployed is an API for two data types and that basic UI. The app is installable -- I used Laravel PWA and a custom [[service-workers]] I wrote. The service worker does provide basic caching, but it's primary purpose is native share withe share API. 


## Halloween

Experiment to create block-based leaves editor with embeddable clippings.

### How Halloween Works

Uses:

- [[next]] next.js
- [[service-workers]]
- [[editorJs]] editor.js
- Github pages
  
## Foam

This site, for now. [[foam-site]]

Could add clippings, leaves, etc of meadow to the [foam graph](https://github.com/foambubble/foam/blob/master/packages/foam-core/src/note-graph.ts) and add interlinking.

Second Brain + Link clipping app is a nice MVP for meadow, right? Does that rule even apply here?

## Link Share/ Clippings With Quotebacks (MVP) + Clippings Plug-in For Gutenberg (MVP+1)

Use existing meadow app for clipping share. Maybe keep levaes as small private notes. Link shares shown publicly with quote backs.js

Create WordPress plug-in/lib for quotebacks.js

Create clippings WordPress plug-in that makes all clippings into reusable blocks, rendered with quotebacks
