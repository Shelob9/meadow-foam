This site, for now. [[foam-site]]

Could add clippings, leaves, etc of meadow to the [foam graph](https://github.com/foambubble/foam/blob/master/packages/foam-core/src/note-graph.ts) and add interlinking.

Second Brain + Link clipping app is a nice MVP for meadow, right? Does that rule even apply here?
