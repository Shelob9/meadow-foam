Culture affects Internet usage, e-commerce trust, information and communication technology adoption, Internet marketing, and website development.

I have lived in 4 countries, 3 continents, and had the opportunities to design for users of Europe, North and South America, Asia, and Southeast Asia. In this article, I will share tips and tricks learned from designing for various cultures, and how to apply culture differences in user experience design.
