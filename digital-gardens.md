# Digital garden

> The term “digital garden” is not well-defined. In general, it is a collection of thoughts, unfinished projects, links, and much more. However, it can be different and wholly unique to the individual. I would like to broaden the term to enclose any sort of website that allows you to truly browse without viewing posts chronologically. Digital gardens, collections, spaces — call it what you want.

I use this site as a digital garden, it is full of of in progress notes about different things I am thinking about or am working on.

[Maggie Appleton](https://maggieappleton.com/) describes [her digital garden](https://maggieappleton.com/garden/) as an "An open collection of notes, resources, sketches, and explorations I'm currently cultivating. Some notes are Seedlings, some are budding, and some are fully grown Evergreen."

This bubble -- I use [[foam]] -- is mainly about making open source digital gardens. My [[theory-of-cms]] bubble is about why I see Digital Gardens and graph databases as being useful.

>[People who spend a lot of time exploring these subcultures feel like they can see into the future, and for good reason. What happens online often shows up in the headlines weeks, months, or even years later. The internet has become the petri dish of culture — the soil in which new movements and novel conversations find root.](https://aaronzlewis.com/2020/07/07/the-garden-of-forking-memes)


## Building Your Own Digital Garden Site

If you look through this [Twitter Thread of digital gardens](https://twitter.com/Mappletons/status/1250532315459194880?s=09
), you may notice most of them are built with a [[static-stite-generator]], most likely [[gatsby]]. I have not found great no-code tools for it yet, besides a public Roam, which is a great solution.

### Gatsby Themes

A really neat example of a digital garden site is [Andy Matuschak's](http://andymatuschak.org/) [note site](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/). It has a lot of Roam-like features including double bracket bi-directional links and content opens in sidebars.

There are several digital garden [[gatsby]] themes that can be used to create sites like that. They use markdown and/ or a personal Roam database as the data source.

There are several [[gatsby]] themes or plugins to help create a site like this. There are two I have tried and think are quite useful.

The first is [Theme Andy](https://github.com/aravindballa/gatsby-theme-andy). This theme uses [theme-ui](https://theme-ui.com/home/), which means it should play nicely with a lot of Gatsby starters and MDX implimentations.

[Gatsby Digital Garden](https://github.com/mathieudutour/gatsby-digital-garden) has a similar look -- [check out this demo](https://mathieudutour.github.io/gatsby-digital-garden/) -- and is a bit more involved. It supports double bracket and parenthesis links, as well as sourcing content from Roam. I appreciate that the project is developed as a monorepo and the different packages can be used independently.

### WordPress Plugins

I can not find any WordPress plugins for digital gardens. I should probably make one.
