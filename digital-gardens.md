# Digital garden

I use this site as a digital garden/ second brain.

[Maggie Appleton](https://maggieappleton.com/) describes [her digital garden](https://maggieappleton.com/garden/) as an "An open collection of notes, resources, sketches, and explorations I'm currently cultivating. Some notes are Seedlings, some are budding, and some are fully grown Evergreen."

This bubble -- I use [[foam]] -- is mainly about making open source digital gardens. My [[theory-of-cms]] bubble is about why I see Digital Gardens and graph databases as being useful.

>[People who spend a lot of time exploring these subcultures feel like they can see into the future, and for good reason. What happens online often shows up in the headlines weeks, months, or even years later. The internet has become the petri dish of culture â€” the soil in which new movements and novel conversations find root.](https://aaronzlewis.com/2020/07/07/the-garden-of-forking-memes)
