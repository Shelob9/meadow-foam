## Your Growth Is A Lagging Indicator Of Your Community

- "community without belonging can be more disorienting than no community at all"
- "a community is defined also by a combination of shared interest + values + some sort of goal".

## Healthy Communities

>   “If anyone can join your community, then the people most likely to join are those who are below the average quality of your community because they have the most to gain. Once they’re in, unless contained, they end up harming the health of the community over the long term.”

>"It is our suffering that brings us together. It is not love. Love does not obey the mind, it turns to hate when forced. The bond that binds us is beyond choice. We are brothers. We are brothers in what we share. In pain, which each of us must suffer alone, in hunger, in poverty, in hope, we know our brotherhood. We know it, because we have had to learn it. We know that there is no help for us but from one another, that no hand will save us if we do not reach out our hand. And the hand that you reach out is empty, as mine is. You have nothing. You possess nothing. You own nothing. You are free. All you have is what you are, and what you give.
> - Ursula K Leguin, The Dispossessed

- Can build community around everyone feeling like a misfit, but that doesn't mean you have consensus about what to do about that/ with that energy. 
- Healthy communities value and respect the autonomy of members. 
- Beloning is  human need, facists understand this in a way neo-liberals do not.
  - Deradicalization is about personal relationships. People don't leave cults after an argument, they leave after engaging with people they care with and slowly reframing.
  - The hook for cultists and .. is framing it with your choice. Sold autonomy, must follow. Smoking is an appeal to self-sovereignty.
  - Moana is an example of story of learning parents are lying to protect innocence so she has to go on journey of self-sovereign experience.
- 80% of success of group is about founders, what there values are and intent. Knowing how they will manage disagreements and conflict in advance is key. Small communities may be able to get by on founder values, but doesn't scale.
  - If people care about new community, some memembers not founder will start take steps to maintain it. Others who care about community will see this and will have a recprocial need to do the same. That will shape community for good or bad, so choose first members wisely.
  - "The larger the group the more universal the axioms of the community need to be. AKA the more foundational the story".
- Being a leader that pays the bills that doesn't tell the story is abdicating leadership. This isn't incompatible with listening to everyone and letting everyone speak and letting others lead.
- [The mental tool of inversion](https://fs.blog/2013/10/inversion/) If it's easier to not be stupid than to be a genius, then with community think about what's the way not to be bad for community in any situation.
- Retribution does not preserve your own soul. Do not get contaminated!
