# Standing Desk

Standing desks are great. I am a big fan of standing about 2/3s of the time at my computer. It forces me to take more regular breaks. It's harder to ignore my body when I'm standing.

## Rising Desk

I can't stand all day and I have a desk, so I got this from fully:

I got the larger model beacuse I have two monitors, a mic and a bunch of stones on my desk. The smaller one is probably better if you just have a laptop.

## Standing Mat

You can't stand at a desk all day barefoot. Wearing shoes to work defeats the whole purpose. So I got this from fully:

This mat is so amazing. I love it. It forces me to move around -- standing still all day is very unhealthy/ painful. The texture massages my feet and it provides a fidget-like experience that is helpful for ADD.

If you wear shoes at work, you probably should get a rubber mat. A move mat also would be pretty cool.
