# Meadow Foam

üëã Josh experimenting with [Foam](https://foambubble.github.io/foam/) for notes.

## About Me

- [[php]] and [[JavaScript]] developer
- [Internet Website](https://joshpress.net)
- What I Am Working On [[now]]
- [Mailing List Signup](https://signup.joshpress.net/)
- [Twitter](https://twitter.com/josh412)

## Why

- Collect in progress [[how-tos]] type tutorials.
- Maybe use this as an API source [[foam-api]]
  for [[meadow]].
- Collect code snippings.

## Using Foam

We've created a few Bubbles (markdown documents) to get you started.

- [[inbox]] - a place to write down quick notes to be categorised later
- [[foam-tips]] - tips to get the most out of your Foam workspace
- [[todo]] - a place to keep track of things to do

## Note on `[[wiki-links]]`

‚ö†Ô∏è Until [foambubble/foam#16](https://github.com/foambubble/foam/issues/16) is resolved, `[[wiki-links]]` links (like the links above) won't work in the GitHub Markdown preview (i.e. this Readme on github.com).

They should work as expected in VS Code, and in rendered GitHub Pages.

If GitHub preview (or general 100% support with all Markdown tools) is a requirement, for the time being you can use the standard `[description](page.md)` syntax.
