## Am I A Cyborg?

Is being a cyborg a state you experience when being in a flow state with technology use?

> Computational engines of that broad class prove extremely good at tasks such as sensorimotor coordination, face recognition, voice recognition, etc. But they are not well-suited to deductive logic, planning, and the typical tasks of sequential reason. They are, roughly speaking, "Good at Frisbee, Bad at Logic:" a cognitive profile that is at once familiar and alien. Familiar, because human intelligence clearly has something of that flavor. Yet alien, because we repeatedly transcend these limits, planning family vacations, running economies, solving complex sequential problems, etc., etc.
>
> A powerful hypothesis, which I first encountered in work by David Rumelhart, Paul Smolensky, John McClelland and Geoffrey Hinton, is that we transcend these limits, in large part, by combining the internal operation of a connectionist, pattern-completing device with a variety of external operations and tools which serve to reduce various complex, sequential problems to an ordered set of simpler pattern-completing operations of the kind our brains are most comfortable with.

Yes, but... "I feel like a shitty cyborg. The connection to my perhipherals has a really high latency". If cybernetics refers to i/o and control systems, then does that really describe our primary I/O and are they really embeded.

>the project of understanding human thought and reason is easily and frequently misconstrued. It is misconstrued as the project of understanding what is special about the human brain. No doubt there is something special about our brains. But understanding our peculiar profiles as reasoners, thinkers and knowers of our worlds requires an even broader perspective: one that targets multiple brains and bodies operating in specially constructed environments replete with artifacts, external symbols, and all the variegated scaffoldings of science, art and culture.
>
> Understanding what is distinctive about human reason thus involves understanding the complementary contributions of both biology and (broadly speaking) technology, as well as the dense, reciprocal patterns of causal and co-evolutionary influence that run between them. We cannot see ourselves aright until we see ourselves as nature's very own cyborgs: cognitive hybrids who repeatedly occupy regions of design space radically different from those of our biological forbears. The hard task, of course, is now to transform all this from (mere) impressionistic sketch into a balanced scientific account of the extended mind.

- Are we cyborgs or do we live in a mixed reality space?
- What is the nature of the interaction with our consiousness?
- Have we been cyborgs since tool use began to co-evolve with us?

Western culture tends to think about self as a thing that is inside of ourselves. So things on surface are not seen as integrated with self. Self ontology. 

What new senses could we add? New way to put inputs into the existing perception, new ways to translate things into input signals we sense, and new ways to understand perception. What do we give up to not be human anymore?

Is technology making us more human, in all the worst ways?

Marketters behaviorist, and that's not how the mind works. Behaviorist marketters see consumers as objects waiting to be stimulated by external forces. Stimulus -> action -> loop. Brain doesn't work that way. People look for stimulus, sense is an active process. Behaviorists see sensation as passive, not active, beacuse basis is on what could be observed when they started: response to stimulus.
