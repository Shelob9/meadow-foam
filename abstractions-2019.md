## Building Teams Across 12 timezones

Aaron Aldrich - Elastic

Intentionally globally distributed so they could have engineers/support in 24h.

Hired a CFO first, didn't want worry about details of paying people in different companies properly to be an ongoing problem.

Doesn't identify as remote. Identifies as distributed. Does have offices, most people near offices work from home.

Blog post on Elastic: If you love somebody set them free.

Each team decides on commutation tools , stand-ups or no stand-ups etc.

Most challenges of distributed teams are overcome with deliberate process, except synchronous vs asynchronous communication.

Default to open, let people opt out. All slack channels and email groups and meetings are open. If you want to go to some other team's meeting,that's fine.

Defualt to distributed. All meeting have a Zoom link. Some people are co-located, no zoom link excludes non-locals. Make it OK for kids to be on the call if worker has kids. Record all all hands meetings for review.

1:1 meetings FTW

Timezones Call times cycle through timezones so it's only painful for part of team, and it shifts.

Decisions are slow

Problem of highly diverse teams is culture conflict. Requires careful hiring. Hiring requires by in across the teams they will interact with. Stresses communication skills. Hire slow, never fire over higher fast , fire fast.

They have "Our Source Code". Not values, but things they value, some aspirational, some how they do things. What makes Elastic, Elastic. Work/life balance is a myth. We don't balance friend/life. Your life should be balanced. Has sleep and putting kids to bed blocked on calendar so other team members don't schedule stuff then. Give team space and time to explore outside of priorities.

Create failure & resilience cycles, not perfection.

We all have an accent.

Assume good intent

As you are, are. Come as you are, be as you are. Don't spend spoons on becoming who you're supposed to be

Defined name for employees - elasticians. They send all new employees to special triaining academy for welcoming.

## Keynote scaling applications

Guy from GitHub, had good git puns. On Ruby core team.
Has a cat that likes chewing on tiny feet.
Use threaded vm to eliminate functions. Direct threaded vm to prevent table lookup.
Cons, cars, cdr - 3 functions he impliments when learning a language.

## Socially Engineering your way to better teams
@oliravi 

It's an ongoing process, always reevaluate.

Social engineering: An act that influences a person to take an action that may or may not be in their best interest. Goal is to make people do things without thinking.

Codemash seams like a cool conference.

Observe your team from an outside perspective:
• Perm or temp?
• how long been together?
• existencing communication channels.
• who speaks most often at meetings
• which members prefer to share ideas through other communication channels
• which members strugle with time management.
• how do team members interact differently in meetings vs non-meetings?
• how frequently do senior members pair together with more junior members.
• to what extent do team members use "we" vs "I"?

What do they value????

Make action plan and start with quick wins. Don't go for the flags right away. Small steps.

Observe how and why team members respond to change.

Team members-
What do they value? What in it for them? Why should they do this?

ADKR Model for team managment: Awareness, desire, knowledge, ability, reinforcement. Is pushback for change caused by a lack of any of those? Find which one and address those.

Resolve conflict with a solution and a value that are based on observation.

Be assertive not agressive, make your elevator pitch, follow up with relevant examples and metaphors.
