**These are notes from "High Voltage Living" Salon on 14 August, 2020 led by Visakan Veerasamy.**

How to increase your volatage?

How to create Voltage internally, not relying on external environment.

## Observations From Intros

"Like is more boring then it used to be, how to make it intresting again?"

Hyper-empathy becomes apathy as a coping mechanism.

High voltage is different in your 20s then 30s, etc.

" I like to support people! This is helpful – 6 years ago writing open source software, meeting people around the world, started a company. Burnout from the other side of excitement. Sold the co, work for another, more chill spot now, what’s next. How do I do that with more intent and self-care in the future? What is that? What does it mean?"

"Colours and magic"

"Learned to use masks as a tool to navigate the world. Discovering that these masks have take over me, so that I’m not aware what’s the real me anymore."

"Takes constant awareness to push out of comfort zone and increasing the voltage."

## Emotions And Developing Limits

Can be dangerous if too high voltage. Love Hendrix, very high energy and bright colors, but he died early. If emotional energy is coming from repressed emotions, unresolved emotions, unaddressed issues, it can lead to high productivity, but also high burnout risk.

Getting burned out when earlier was good, beacuse he learned what the limit is. Now can be more sensative. Has to have friends to talk to. To develop Always be talking to a diverse range of peers -- spouse and friends, but also others, perspective from those you don't see often can help you not go too mad.

There are friends and there are serious friends.

What does it mean to be sensative? Sensitivity is about bringing in inputs, smarts is about processing, and strength is the ability to execute on what you have processed. There are strength and smart cults, people who want to fight or debate, they worship strength or smarts. No one workships sensitivity?

Sensitivity is very powerful, easily burned out by mishandling inputs. Sensitivity is first thing that goes out the window in a cohersive environment -- in schools they tell you what to look at, not what you want. Men told to look at the data, it's perceptive, but also leads to under valuing emotions. We choose to be "thinking guy" to avoid "feeling first", not be too dramatic.

You want to be high voltage in yourself, but not burn others in the process. Need to give other people space.

Congrence: Having the self-esteem to act in the way demanded by the situation. Appearing on the outside the same way you feel inside.
